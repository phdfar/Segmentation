Can you get someone to check that before we come, you know, to see that it's working?</br></br>#Person2#: Oh, of course, the technician will be with you when you're setting everything up. Oh, the seats in that room have flap-over desk tops, will that be all right?</br></br>#Person1#: Yes, yes, that's fine, sure.</br></br>#Person2#: You say you've sent out the invitations, any idea how many people there'll be?
